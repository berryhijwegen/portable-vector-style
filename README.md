This tool helps you port style files for Mapbox-GL-JS between three major OpenStreetMap vector tile providers: Mapbox, MapZen and OpenMapTiles. It's at an early proof-of-concept stage.

Remember that not all style files are open sourced. Please do not use this tool to rip off Mapbox's proprietary styles â€“ or anyone else's for that matter..
